If the site stops working,.. then this solution is not for you, we go to point 2<br/><br/> <b>2. Setting up your own <i>php.ini</i> file:</b><br/> Perhaps your hoster allows you to use your own <i>php.ini</i> file.<br/> In this case, you need to set the parameters specified in clause 1 (naturally without the prefix <i>php_flag</i>) in your <i>php.ini</i> file.<br/> <br/> <b>3. If nothing can be done..</b><br/> It may happen that options #1 and #2 are not suitable for you. In this case, you have only one way out - to contact the hoster and ask to configure the parameters.<br/> The fact is that all the above parameters were created to protect sites <i>many years ago</i> and in new versions of PHP they have long been abandoned,.. but sometimes, for compatibility with very old applications, these parameters are still activated. Just explain to the hoster that it's far from 2002 and ask the hoster to help you. I'm sure he (the hoster) will definitely go to meet you."
